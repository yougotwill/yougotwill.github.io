            When I was young, on my weekends I loved looking at Apple products
            in the iStore. I adored how beautiful and clean everything looked -
            right down to the boxes. That was my first introduction into the
            tech world.

            At university, I working on various projects related to internet
            security, artificial intelligence & video games while searching for
            what best fit my skills & interests.

            As the internet continued to grow and new web technologies started

            and my obsession with front-end development was born!

          <p>
            Now I'm an aspiring web developer focusing on front-end. My other
            interests are reading, listening to music, studying Japanese, and
            going on walks (usually to coffee shops or museums).
