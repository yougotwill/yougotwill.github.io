          <p>
            When I was young on my weekends, I loved looking at Apple products
            in the iStore. I adored how beautiful and clean everything looked -
            right down to the boxes. That was my first introduction into the
            tech world.
          </p>

          <p>
            At university, I working on various projects related to internet
            security, artificial intelligence & video games while searching for
            what best fit my skills & interests.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the internet continued to grow and new web technologies started
            to become a part of our daily lives, I realised I had a good eye for
            what made products <span className="special">"look good"</span> and
            my obsession with front-end development was born!
          </p>

          <p>
            Now I'm an aspiring web developer focusing on front-end. My other
            interests are studying Japanese, listening to music and going on
            walks (usually to coffee shops or museums).
